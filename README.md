# Set-up for JAVA ATM
1. Please right click on the Java folder and select Mark Directory as "Source Root" after cloning the respository.  


2. To use the ATM, you must log in as either an ATM worker (Bank Manager or Bank Advisor) or a customer. The workers.txt and customers.txt contain some usernames and passwords that can be used to log-in to the ATM. When a new worker or customer is created, the usernames and passwords of the new users will be saved and written into the respective files. For more information please feel free to explore the ReadMe files inside of the folders.  
* To log in as a Bank Manager, enter bm as the username, 123 for the password, and then press Bank Login
* To log in as a Bank Advisor, enter ba1 as the username, 123 for the password, and then press Bank Login
* To log in as a customer, create a new customer using a Bank Manager


3. A functionalirty of this ATM is deposting money into bank accounts. To store this information, we use a file called deposits. txt. This file needs to be manually created so in the files folder, please create a new text file called deposits.txt. Please explore the README section to see how to format information in deposits.txt.
