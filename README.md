To access the ATM, you must log in as either an ATM worker (Bank Manager or Bank Advisor) or a customer. The text files workers.txt and customers.txt, both found in the Files folder, currently contain some usernames and passwords that you can use to log in. Every time a new worker or customer is created, the usernames and passwords of the new users will be written into these files respectively (for more information regarding the format of said text files, please see the 'Files' section of this README).
To log in as a Bank Manager, enter bm as the username, 123 for the password, and then press Bank Login
To log in as a Bank Advisor, enter ba1 as the username, 123 for the password, and then press Bank Login
To log in as a customer, create a new customer using a Bank Manager
One of the functionalities of this ATM is depositing money into a user's bank account. To store information regarding deposits, we use a file called deposits.txt. This file needs to be manually created. In the files folder, please create a new text file called deposits.txt. See the Files section of this README to see how to format information stored in deposits.txt.
